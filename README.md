## What is Spring Data REST?
Spring Data REST's mission is to provide a familiar and consistent, Spring-based programming model for data access while still retaining the special traits of the underlying data store.
It makes it easy to use data access technologies, relational and non-relational databases, map-reduce frameworks, and cloud-based data services.

**In this repository, weâ€™re gonna build a Spring Data REST example in Spring Boot with Maven that uses Spring Data JPA to interact with Postgres database.**
